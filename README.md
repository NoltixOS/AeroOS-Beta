# Xsoft OS 1.0
Xsoft OS 1.0 is the first official OS by Xsoft.

# Summoning the OS
You can summon the OS by finding the data.bat file. you can find it easily by scrolling until you find a file with D at the start of their name and if it is data.bat open it. if not, then scroll down(NOTE: do not use the search option because it won't work. try finding it without searching!)

## Make sure to:
After you download, rename the folder to _Xsoft (nu sterge aici nu e nimic pierdut.)_, renaming to this name will automatically install all the important drivers :)
